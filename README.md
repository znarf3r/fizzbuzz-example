# FizzBuzz Example

This small program prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with a twist 🎉! For multiples of three it prints “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “FizzBuzz”.

To run it you need to have node.js (https://nodejs.org/) installed and you call it by typing `node .` from within the root of this project.
